# Data Structure
A data structure is like a blueprint that shows how data is connected and organized.

To understand this better, let's look at a common data structure called an array.

An **Array** is a group of similar things. It's a data structure because it helps us see how data is arranged in memory and how they relate to each other.

A more formal definition of a data structure is:
'**Data structure** is a special way of organizing, processing, finding, changing, and storing data. Data structures are like plans for organizing data to meet specific needs. They don't just store data, they also keep track of how the data is connected.'[^1]

## Operations on Data Structures
Arrays are a fundamental data structure that requires various operations to function effectively. These operations include:
1. **Traversal**: This involves accessing each element of an array in a sequential order, either from start to end or vice versa.
2. **Insertion**: This is the process of adding a new element to an array. The new element can be inserted at the beginning, end, or any other position within the array, depending on the application. Existing elements may shift to accommodate the new element.
3. **Deletion**: This operation involves removing an existing element from an array. Similar to insertion, an element can be deleted from any position within the array, and existing elements may shift to fill the gap.
4. **Search**: This process involves finding a specific element within an array by comparing the target element with each element in the array until a match is found.
5. **Sorting**: This operation involves arranging elements in a specific order.
